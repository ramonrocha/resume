            <p>I have been involved in the IT market since 1986, and my career has been diverse. I started as an employee at CEMIG, where I was one of the first civil servants in MG and was involved in various processes within the company. Seeking new challenges, I moved to São Paulo (SP) and worked in different law, economics, and technology sectors. During this time, I enthusiastically participated in implementing and developing the Internet in Brazil and witnessed its entire evolution. This experience has given me extensive professional knowledge in deploying one of Brazil's first online TVs (TV Online - SNET) and creating initial web systems for various companies in the market. These web solutions have helped many companies advance technologically, optimizing processes and simplifying financial and personnel management. Throughout my career, I have excelled in prospecting new clients, developing controls, coordinating teams and projects, and managing administrative sectors and companies. I always strive for maximum efficiency in all activities while nurturing my professional and personal growth.</p>
            <p>I have experience working in the Internet industry, having held various roles such as developer, analyst, and project coordinator for multiple companies. One of my responsibilities was creating data synchronization routines between the ERP Protheus Advanced from Microsiga (now part of TOTVS solutions) and other platforms like AS/400. My accomplishments include achieving TOP10 rankings three times in a row at the Prêmio iBest and winning the Personal Sports category in 2005. I have also worked as an independent consultant for Ogilvy One do Brasil, a multinational marketing and advertising company, where I worked on web projects. As an autonomous consultant, I offered solutions for fully automating fuel stations using software and hardware technologies from Xpert Solutions. I have also been responsible for the commercial automation of companies across various sectors, such as retail, restaurants, and e-commerce.</p>
            <p>From 2007 to 2009, I held the position of Factory Manager at Bellatrix Ind. Com. Imp. e Exp. Ltda. I played a pivotal role in the company's operations during this period. My primary responsibilities extended beyond overseeing construction and establishment; I actively collaborated with government entities to secure essential fiscal incentives, significantly contributing to our operational success. Additionally, I directed the production process during its initial stages, ensuring a smooth and efficient start. Following this tenure, I was promoted to the role of General Manager. In this capacity, I expanded my responsibilities to encompass cybersecurity initiatives, including network security, application security, and information security. I designed and implemented protocols to safeguard confidential data within the organization and during external interactions. Furthermore, I orchestrated training programs to ensure employees' compliance with these protocols, fostering a secure digital environment. Moreover, my role involved managing the importation of raw materials and products for resale, overseeing purchasing processes, and providing comprehensive administrative guidance for the factory's local operations. This multifaceted experience uniquely positioned me to contribute effectively to the company's success across various domains.</p>
            <p>Between 2009 and 2010, I served as Co-owner and Manager at Arquivar Montes Claros. My primary duties included implementing Electronic Document Management systems for clients and providing strategic management and training for clients and employees. This initiative was a significant technological advancement, allowing for more efficient electronic data and information management through indexing and search capabilities. Not only did it greatly benefit businesses, but it also contributed to environmental preservation by reducing paper printing and improving sustainability.</p>
            <p>I have experience working as a Supply/IT/EMM Manager at ECEL Engenharia e Construções Ltda from 2012 to 2015. My responsibilities included managing the supply chain, procurement, EMM supervision, and IT resources such as computing, telephony, and internet. In mid-2015, I took on the role of General Administrative Manager while still managing my previous responsibilities, as well as financial resource management, personnel management, and operational control of CEMIG's contract resources in Ipatinga, João Monlevade, Itabira, Guanhães, and surrounding regions. Through my leadership, I overcame financial challenges in the contract and maintained smooth operations, improved financial management, and optimized operational logistics for the services provided.</p>
            <p>Between 2006 and 2018, I held the position of Co-owner and Analyst-Programmer at Techvia Informática Ltda. I actively developed tailored systems for clients on desktop and internet platforms during this period. Additionally, I created websites, e-commerce systems, and structured networks. My responsibilities extended to providing user support and ensuring the seamless functionality of these systems.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I spearheaded the implementation of cutting-edge cybersecurity and machine learning protocols, contributing to network, information, and application security. By integrating advanced technologies, I protected sensitive data for businesses in both internal and external environments.</p>
            <p>Simultaneously, as indicated above, I served as an independent consultant, leveraging my comprehensive expertise in technology, administrative, and financial management. Alongside my role at Techvia Informática Ltda, I concurrently held other positions. As a Factory Manager at Bellatrix Ind. Com. Imp. e Exp. Ltda, I oversaw crucial aspects of the company's operations, including construction and establishment, fiscal incentive acquisition, and initial production management. Additionally, at ECEL Engenharia e Construções Ltda, I took on roles such as Supply Manager and General Manager, contributing insights and strategies as an autonomous consultant.</p>
            <p>This diverse professional journey uniquely positions me to provide valuable contributions across various domains, leveraging my extensive experience in technology and its applications for cybersecurity, data privacy, and business growth.</p>
